## 📄 Publication

- **Title:** A staged wildfire evacuation model for wildland-urban interface communities with transient populations  
- **Journal:** International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction (IJDRR), Volume 126, Article 105625

The study develops and tests a staged wildfire evacuation model for WUI communities with transient populations, using predefined evacuation zones (PEZs) and the Multi-Agent Transport Simulation (MATSim) framework. The model produces evacuation time estimates (ETEs), traffic counts on road links, and individual travel times, and compares staged evacuation strategies with simultaneous evacuation to assess their impact on congestion and clearance times.

## 🎥 Demo video

The `video/` folder contains a short demo that illustrates:

- How staged evacuations are configured using predefined evacuation zones  
- How traffic conditions evolve under staged vs. simultaneous evacuation
